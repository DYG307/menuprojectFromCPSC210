# My Personal Project, a Menu/order tracker

## Paragraph explaining project
This application will be a digital menu tracker for a resturant. The application will keep track of tables and what they have ordered.
People who would use this project would be resturants. The application will be able to add new menu items and will be able to reprogram and add or 
remove tables depending on needs. The reason I am intrested in this project is because the restureant near my house has a really old application
used for keeping track of everything, so they are very slow with the billing and efficeny of the resturant is slow due to the bad software.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add food items and prices.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a bill for a customer.
- As a user, I want to be able to add all the orders and get a final bill with server info
- As a user, If nothing is ordered I want the program to display nothing has been ordered
- As a user, I want the program to be able to manually add the table number \
- As a user, I want the program to be able to get a daily report of the resturants earnings
